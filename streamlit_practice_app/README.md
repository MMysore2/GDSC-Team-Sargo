Fear not, using running this web app is pretty straight forward. First, 
pip install streamlit
next, run: 
streamlit run tutorial 
A chrome browser should have opened with the web app being displayed.....It looks pretty barebones, but we should be able to style everything using CSS? (I think you can implement CSS, JavaScript and HTML, markdowns if you are looking to do something that is not built into the streamlit library.
